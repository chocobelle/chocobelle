안녕하세요. Hello.

I am Isabelle. This is my side account - my main account is at [@izzycodes02](https://github.com/izzycodes02)

I am a solo developer building **Bokbi** — an upcoming cross-platform reading tracker for fandom readers, web fiction fans, and anyone juggling stories across multiple sites.

Tech I use daily:
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js  
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Styling:** SCSS, TailwindCSS  

I work mostly in private repos, pushing quietly until something is ready to ship.

I just build, test, and release when it’s good enough to use.

Fun-fact:
- Always learning and improving — suggestions and pointers are always welcome.
- I like Great Dane dogs and black rabbits.
